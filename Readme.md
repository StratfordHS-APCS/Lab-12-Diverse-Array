# Lab 12 - Diverse Array

## Lab Goal
You should have already completed AP free response problem #1 from 2015 before completing this lab.  This lab is for you to verify your answer to that problem.  Type in the code you wrote and see how you did.

## Instructions
 * Complete the `arraySum` method to calculate and return the sum of the entries in a one-dimentional array.
 * Complete the `rowSums` method to calculate and return a one-dimensional array containing the sums of the rows of the array.
 * Complete the `isDiverse` method to return `true` if each row of the array has a different sum.
 * You do not need to edit the `main` method.
 * Make sure you add a javadoc comment on each method.  You'll need to include a `@param` tag for each method that accepts a parameter.  Include a `@return` tag on any method that returns a value.

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* 20 - `arraySum` works correctly
* 40 - `rowSums` works correctly
* 30 - `isDiverse` works correctly
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
